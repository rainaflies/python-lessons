# Math Quiz Game

## Description

This is a simple Python program that runs an interactive math quiz game. The game consists of five basic addition problems that the user must answer.

## How It Works

1. The program starts by initializing the user's score to `0`.

2. It then asks the user to input their name and greets them with a welcome message.

3. The program presents a series of five math problems to the user. The problems are simple addition problems (i.e., "2 + 2", "4 + 5", "2 + 4", "7 + 0", "6 + 4"). For each problem, the user is asked to input their answer.

4. The program checks the user's answer against the correct answer for each problem. If the user's answer is correct, the program increments the user's score by `1` and prints a success message. If the user's answer is incorrect, the program prints a failure message.

5. After all five problems have been presented and answered, the program prints the user's final score.

6. Finally, the program thanks the user for playing and invites them to come back tomorrow.

## Notes

This game is very basic and does not provide any error handling for non-numeric or unexpected input. It's a good starting point for a more complex game, but as it stands, it's mainly useful for beginners or young children learning addition.
