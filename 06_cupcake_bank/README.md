# Cupcake Bank

Cupcake Bank is a basic banking simulation for little kids built using Python. It's designed to allow users to make deposits and withdrawals, check their balance, and even buy a cupcake if their account has enough balance. The program requires a static password like an ATM.

## Features

- Deposit: You can add money to your account.
- Withdraw: You can withdraw money from your account, given you have enough balance.
- Check Balance: You can check your account balance.
- Buy a Cupcake: You can buy a cupcake, but only if you have a minimum of $3 in your account.

## Usage

To use the Cupcake Bank program, follow these steps after running it with Python:

1. Enter the password. The current password is "9999".
2. After a successful login, you will be presented with a menu to perform common banking actions like deposit, withdraw and check balance. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.
